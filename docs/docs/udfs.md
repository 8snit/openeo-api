# User-defined functions

_Work in progress!_

The abbreviation **UDF** stands for **user-defined function**. With this concept, users are able to upload custom code and have it executed e.g. for every pixel of a scene, allowing custom calculations on server-side data.

User-defined functions (UDFs) can be exposed to the data in different ways. This includes which parts of the data are passed to the function, how the function execution is parallelized, and how the expected output is structured.
