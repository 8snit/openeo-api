# User-defined functions

The abbreviation **UDF** stands for **user-defined function**. With this concept, users are able to upload custom code and have it executed e.g. for every pixel of a scene, allowing custom calculations on server-side data.

More information regarding the current proposal for UDFs can be found in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-udf).
